DIGITAL CURATION

This course concerns the life cycle, value-added management and maintenance of scholarly and scientific digital content. Digital curation requires a diverse set of skills to select, execute and administer a range of approaches and procedures across the lifecycle of digital objects, from conceptualization, creation, appraisal and selection, and ingest through preservation, storage, access, use and re-use. Lifecycle management of digital content transcends boundaries and occurs across a broad array of professional, disciplinary and organizational contexts. This course introduces principles and practices to inform digital curation planning and implementation for application in a variety of organizational settings, including archives, libraries, museums, data centers, and other cultural heritage and information agencies.
