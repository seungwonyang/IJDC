Digital Preservation and Curation

We are all aware that digital technologies are changing every aspect of our lives. They have transformed how we create, play, work, and share. Ensuring the long term access to digital materials generated through our use of these technologies has become a cornerstone of the information professions. There is an expectation that information professionals are cognisant of the challenges to the preservation and curation of digital materials and the approaches to addressing them. This course will enable students to acquire just that knowledge.
This course examines the creation, curation, conservation, and preservation of digital materials in both the public and private sectors and enables students to develop an appreciation of the principles of management of digital information in the context of digital longevity. Students gain an understanding of the organizational, technical, social, and economic challenges encountered when enabling the long-term availability of digital materials. It provides an introduction to key models, workflows (from pre-ingest to dissemination), policies, characteristics of digital repositories, standards, metadata, annotation, audit and certification, technical approaches from hardware preservation to emulation, and future research challenges that need to be addressed if the preservation landscape is to be transitioned out of an arts and craft mode.

Summarizing the challenges and approaches to digital preservation within the context of institutions working with documents and data (demonstrated in class activities and assignments 1, 3, and 4);

describing core research issues and directions in the area of digital curation and preservation (partially demonstrated in assignment 1 and 3 and more fully in assignment 4);
organising practical activities (e.g. format identification, preservation options identification and assessment) related to digital preservation (demonstrated in class activities and assignment 2, 3 and 4);
implementing workflow modelling, metadata definition, and ingest process management (demonstrated in class activities and assignment 1, 3 and 4);
using knowledge related to digital object assessment, and audit and certification of digital repositories to manage curation and preservation processes (demonstrated in class activities and assignment 3 and 4);
applying a working knowledge of the techniques and practices that underlie digital curation (demonstrated in assignments 2, 3 and 4);

characterize preservation scenarios and identify key issues in given environments (demonstrated in assignments 1, 3 and 4 and in class activities);
explaining the issues of authenticity, integrity, and reliability in relation to digital preservation and curation (demonstrated in assignment 3 and 4); and
integrating digital curation and preservation requirements in approaches to defining and establishing a digital repository (demonstrated in assignment 3 and 4).

Lecture and Discussion Focus: Information Encoding, Representation, and File Formats
Team Activity: File Type Identification Challenge
(Each group will be given a set of files to identify. The names will be meaningless and the file extensions will be deleted. The objective will be to work out what types of files they are, to save them with meaningful names and appropriate extensions, and to explain what tools and strategies your team used to complete the task in coherent, consistent, robust, and documented way.)
