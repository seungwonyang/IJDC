Data Curation and Management

This class explores the full range of data curation lifecycle activities, from the design of good data through content creator management, metadata creation, ingest into a repository, repository management, access policies and implementation, to data reuse. Data management plans for various funders such as NSF and NIH will be explored.

Grasp the urgency of and need for long-term data curation in public and private venues
• Define data and identify their roles in organizational, technological, legal, cultural, and
business contexts
• Understand both theoretical and practical issues in data curation from a broad range of
perspectives
• Describe central data curation concepts, terms, tools, and technologies
• Be familiar with the current state of knowledge in the field and its key research issues as well
as past trends and emerging priorities
• Understand the data curation lifecycle and identify the activities associated with each stage
and their social, legal, ethical, and policy implications
• Understand the archival continuum model and how it relates to data curation.
• Understand the variety of data types generated and used by various disciplines, sub-
disciplines, and research communities
• Understand how data curation relates to and has changed scholarship and research
• Examine the challenges associated with data sharing for collaboration and re-use
• Discuss roles for libraries and archives in data curation
• Understand the role of archival principles in data curation
• Delineate roles and responsibilities for data curators
• Understand the importance of planning to successful data curation
Discuss public policy for data (scientific, governmental, and scholarly)
• Identify optimal data curation standards and best practices
• Understand crucial issues associated with storage, backup, and security of data
• Engage with challenges surrounding sustainability, auditing, risk management, trust, and
costing
• Become familiar with current data curation education efforts
