Data Curation

LBSCI 790. Data Curation. 3 hr.; 3cr. The course surveys data practices and services of different disciplines and research teams. The course introduces students to the fundamentals of data, such as types, forms, formats, and life cycle of data; the data management and curation practices in research teams, libraries, archives, and institutional repositories; and the technical standards for data and metadata.

Data curation is the activity of managing the use of data throughout its lifecycle to ensure it is available for contemporary purpose, discovery, and future reuse. The course provides an overview of data practices and services of different disciplines and research teams, and the theoretical and practical problems in data curation. The course introduces students to the fundamentals of data, such as types, forms, formats, and life cycle of data; data use and management policies; the data management and curation practices in research teams, libraries, archives, and institutional repositories; the technical standards for data and metadata; and data and metadata quality assessment and assurance.

1. Identify the types, forms, formats, and lifecycle of data in different contexts
2. Gain a basic understanding of data policies and data practices in different research settings
3. Gain the technical skills in managing data in different research settings
4. Develop data curation profile to provide access to data collections, repositories, and services
