Digital Curation

Management and preservation of digital objects and records throughout their lifecycle. Essential technologies and standards for building and maintaining robust, trusted digital repositories. Emphasizes the use and reuse of scholarly data, business and government records, cultural heritage materials, and other digital objects to create resources supporting communities of practice in their work. Prerequisite: LIS 60631, 60638, 80631, 80638; or graduate standing.

To define digital curation as it applies in information organizations and cultural heritage institutions, as well as other corporate, scientific, and government contexts;
• To establish the responsibilities of digital curators;
• To explore how data, records, and other types of digital materials are created,
used, and reused, for the purpose of understanding the lifecycle of digital
information;
• To investigate various methods for building and maintaining digital repositories,
including approaches to acquisition, selection, and/or appraisal of digital material, tools for creating required technical and administrative metadata, and models for digital workflows;
• To review the standards and processes by which trusted digital repositories are established and maintained, including risk evaluation and management, and auditing of repositories;
• To discuss policy concerns and challenges in the areas of data ethics, intellectual property, long-term sustainability, and development of technical standards.

Describe the digital curation lifecycle model and apply it to the design and implementation of digital repositories;
Identify and define characteristics of communities of practice in the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and other user groups and institutions;
• Articulate approaches to appraisal, selection, and disposal of digital objects for institutional repositories;
• Assess the suitability of toolsets and other software for implementation in preservation activities;
• Demonstrate knowledge of automatic metadata generation tools through exploration of format identification and validation software;
• Analyze functional and institutional needs for preservation repository architecture and make recommendations for metadata standards, repositories, and other technologies suitable for achieving preservation goals;
• Articulate requirements for the certification of a trusted digital repository and evaluate the preservation readiness of an institution by using the appropriate assessment tool;
• Create a preservation plan to preserve a digital collection;
• Articulate policy challenges to digital curation presented by scholarly practices,
intellectual property restrictions, and long-term sustainability.
