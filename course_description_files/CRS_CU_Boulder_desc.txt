DIGITAL CURATION

This course focuses on the creation of a multimodal personal research archive and the theories of digital curation writ large that inform its production.
As researchers, our interest in the archive as a site of theoretical and pragmatic inquiry has been transformed by emergent media, and specifically, the new affordances of digitization in terms of access, storage, circulation and searchability. As such, both the ways in which we generate for the archive, and our reliance on what we can extract from it, have become increasingly important conceptual and methodological issues. Arguably, ontologies of the archive -- which remain largely based on authenticity, rivalry, and the originality of artefacts and official records -- are always challenged by new and emergent media.
This seminar will attempt to follow some of these discussions as they intersect different fields of scholarship and practice: media archaeology, feminist, queer, and post-colonial theories, and communication and media studies. Together, we will engage with the archive as place, concept and representational practice.
To do this, we will walk you through the necessary steps in creating a personal research archive using the free open source content management system, Wordpress, as well as exploring tools for non-linear database driven media, such as Korsakow, and other options tailored to your needs and particular areas of interest. This class should nudge you along your current research trajectory, while also, hopefully, challenging your research direction in positive ways.
This course includes engagement with theories of production, weekly class discussions, screenings, readings, student presentations, collaborative in-class work, field trips, lectures and guest lectures, workshops, media archaeological interventions, and hands-on demonstrations... all this to help you gain a better understanding of the research tools at your disposal, deepen your knowledge of those you are currently using, as well as introduce new ones. All production work follows from a critical engagement with media and an awareness of methodology, positionally, and process.
A laptop is required for the course. You will also be required to purchase server space and a domain name if you do not already have one (the how-to pertaining to this will be covered in class). No specific technical skills are required for this course other than an openness an eagerness to learn.
