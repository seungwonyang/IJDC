Policy Issues in Digital Curation

Discussion of strategies to address intellectual property, privacy, security and other policy concerns raised by the curation of digital records and data.

Policy Issues in Digital Curation will explore responses to the intellectual property, privacy, and security issues related to curation and long-term preservation of digital information. Bridging law, social science, computer science, and professional practice, this course will focus on understanding and responding to copyright and other forms of intellectual property raised by preservation copies of digital data and records; dealing with complex privacy issues in digital data and records; securing integrity and trust in digital information and content throughout the information lifecycle; and implementing security for digital information in a range of contexts. Applied group and individual work will focus on developing policy and technical responses to intellectual property, privacy, security, and accessibility issues.

Demonstrate broad understanding of major information policy issues in the curation of digital records and data.
• Describe why intellectual property, privacy, security, and access requirements exist, including how expectations and policies differ between cultures and contexts.
• Evaluate policy opportunities and risks for curating digital records and data in professional and institutional settings.
• Propose policy and technical approaches to digital curation challenges in areas such as intellectual property, privacy, security, and access.
• Demonstrate knowledge of the technical and human resource dimensions of implementing and enforcing policy requirements for digital curation.
