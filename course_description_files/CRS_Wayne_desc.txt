This course provides students with an understanding of the theoretical principles and practical aspects of digital curation and preservation within libraries, museums, archives and other institutions administering data and digital content. Students examine critical issues and challenges surrounding long- term digital preservation and curation. Topics examined include digitization and preservation standards; selection criteria; copyright and professional ethics; the data curation lifecycle; strategies for preservation; metadata; integrity and authenticity of digital content; trusted digital repositories; risk management; and current research and development. The goals of this course are 1) to increase the studentsâ€™ awareness and understanding of the multiplicity of digital curation and preservation issues, and 2) to develop their knowledge further through hands-on practical skills learned while curating and preserving data and digital content.
