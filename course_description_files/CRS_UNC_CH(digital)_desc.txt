Digital Forensics for Curation of Digital Collections

Students will learn about hardware, software, principles and methods for capturing and curating digital data that have been stored on removable media (ie: hard drives, floppy disks, USB memory sticks). This course addresses common storage devices and interfaces; write-blocking equipment and its role in acquisition of data; levels of representation; basic filesystem structures; role and importance of hash values and hex views of bitstreams; software used to conduct forensics tasks; considerations for incorporating forensics into curation workflows; and legal and ethical issues. Students will have the opportunity to use a range of state-of-the-art digital forensics hardware and (commercial and open-source) software and explore ways that they can be applied by information professionals in a variety of collecting contexts.

Understand the major levels of representation in digital collections
• Investigate implications of diferent levels of representation for digital
curation activities
• Working familiarity with hardware and software for the acquisition of
data from storage media
• Understand implications of digital foresnics tools and methods for long-
term curation of digital data
