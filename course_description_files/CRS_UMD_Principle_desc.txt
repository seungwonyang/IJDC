Principles of Digital Curation

This course explores various dimensions and contexts of digital curation. For the purpose of this class, digital curation encompasses all activities involving the management, representation, and preservation of both born-digital and turned- digital information for current and future use. We shall reflect on current efforts that respond to the opportunities and the attendant challenges and demands of ever-increasing digital data and networked information infrastructure. To do this, we shall also look into the infrastructure necessary for handling digital collections as well as the knowledge and skills necessary for effective management of digital curation systems and programs.
This course will take a comparative approach in examining the principles, standards, and practices that institutions apply over digital collections. While traversing various forms and practices—from institutional repositories, digital libraries, cyberinfrastructure, and virtual archives to practices of digital preservation, data curation, electronic records management, web archiving and digital assets management—we shall examine the role of electronic and networked technology in the long-term preservation of and access to digital assets and digital heritage collections. As a foundation course for the Curation and Management of Digital Assets (CMDA) certificate, this course is designed to provide students with a broad understanding of current trends, issues, and challenges in managing digital collections, as well as a greater appreciation of the changing landscape of digital collections contemporary landscape.

This course presents an introductory overview for the CMDA program with the goal of providing a framework for digital curators in training by introducing key concepts, models, and skills.

Identify and assess key models, strategies, and standards for digital curation;
● Articulate an understanding of key concepts and approaches to digital
preservation;
● Evaluate digital curation policies and methods for organizational
implementation in designing plans for the stewardship of digital assets;
● Develop a basic conceptual model about cloud computing infrastructure that
supports digital curation;
● Identify resources that support professional, digital curation practices in
various sorts of organizations;
● Identify and assess the data needs of a designated community;
● Create a digital curation plan for an institution and/or a collection, prioritize
recommendations, and communicate recommendations to stakeholders.
