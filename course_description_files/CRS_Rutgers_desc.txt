Fundamentals of Big Data Curation and Management

This course introduces students to the use of large data sets and prepares them for work in either a corporate data analytics world or in a major scientific archive. Students would learn the beginnings of how to design, manage and exploit large textual, graphical and numeric data collections

By the end of the course, students will be able to:
1. Define what “Big Data” commonly means, and explain its role, purpose, and impact in various industries and in research. Students will be able to describe applications in medicine, marketing and climate science.
2. Identify and distinguish at least three kinds of data: numeric data, text data and network data. Perform at least one practical calculation with each kind of data.
3. Describe needs and techniques for data input, including sources of data, format conversion, data description (metadata), and data quality measurement. Compare opportunities and risks in new input methods, specifically crowd-sourcing and sensors.
4. Evaluate the use of various technologies (e.g. Perl and R) and approaches (e.g. mean, SD, box-plots) for exploratory data analysis and modeling. Use a few basic visualizations such as box plots and graphs to present data, and use geographic data to present data in a mapped format.
5. Perform at least three specific exercises in data analysis for the three main data types: predict the next element in a numerical time series, compile a translation dictionary, and compute the shortest path in a network (abstract graph).
6. Explain the computing needs of “big data” problems, including specifically relational databases, parallel computing and mobile computing.
7. Visualize or model the answers to one practical question using one of the supplied datasets.
