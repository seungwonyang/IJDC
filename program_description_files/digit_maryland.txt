The Archives and Digital Curation specialization focuses on the creation, management and use, long-term preservation, and current and future access to records and information, both analog, and digital, in a variety of disciplines and sectors of the economy. Information is at the very heart of a modern societyâ€™s ability to learn, conduct business, recreate, and manage complex scientific, technological, industrial, and information infrastructures. It is a societal imperative that there be qualified professionals with the technical, intellectual, and social awareness required to manage complex collections of analog, born-digital, or digitized materials in a variety of organizational settings. Access to information is essential for a vibrant and healthy democracy. Archivists, data curation managers and specialists, and other information professionals assist citizens seeking to assert their legal rights, hold public officials accountable and understand the documentary heritage of their community. In a diverse and multi-cultural world, access to records and information is a right that information professionals help to ensure. The challenges (technological, professional, and political) are great but the rewards are even greater. Students graduating from this specialization will have the academic, technical, and practical skills to work in diverse organizational settings such as the commercial sector, cultural heritage organizations, the digital arts and humanities, and scientific research and development. Students will master core competencies to manage the records life cycle and will demonstrate mastery in hands-on field study opportunities.
